My major is mainly working with Ruby/Rails. Currently I’m working as a backend developer at Tokyo, Japan. I’m planning to take a deep dive into Ruby/Rails, I’m also learn another backend programming language (maybe Go) and the new fastest growing JS framework: VueJS. I really like a Steve’s saying: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.”"},{"title":"Categories","date":"2018-02-27T17:28:23.444Z","updated":"2018-02-27T15:12:54.843Z","comments":true,"path":"categories/index.html","permalink":"https://thieunv.me/categories/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"Tags","date":"2018-02-27T17:28:23.470Z","updated":"2018-02-27T15:12:54.843Z","comments":true,"path":"tags/index.html","permalink":"https://thieunv.me/tags/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""}],"posts":[]}
